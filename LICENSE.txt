📜 THE "OFF-LIMITS" SCROLL
Copyright (c) 2026 Abdelrahman Elnahrawy

BY VIEWING THIS CODE, YOU AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING INCANTATIONS:

1. THE "LOOK BUT DON'T TOUCH" RULE:
   You are granted the right to gaze upon this code with your eyes. 
   You may bask in its glory. You may even learn from it. However, 
   the moment you Copy (Ctrl+C) and Paste (Ctrl+V) this into your 
   own project, a digital curse shall be placed upon your keyboard.

2. THE "NO STEALING" OATH:
   If you fork this repo, change the name, and tell your friends 
   you wrote it, your coffee will always be lukewarm and your 
   code will never compile on the first try.

3. THE "BOSS/TEACHER" CLAUSE:
   Using this code to pass a class or impress a boss without 
   mentioning my name is a violation of the Universal Laws of 
   Developer Karma. 

4. THE "COFFEE" EXCEPTION:
   If you absolutely MUST use this code, you must first embark on 
   a quest to find the author (Me) and offer a tribute of caffeine 
   or a sincere "Thank You." Only then may the barrier be lifted.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS". IF YOU STEAL IT AND IT 
EXPLODES, I WILL SIMPLY LAUGH FROM THE SIDElines.

STAY HANDS-OFF, MORTAL.
